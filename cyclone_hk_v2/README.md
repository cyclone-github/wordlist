It's time for a new, updated cyclone_hk wordlist. "cyclone_hk_v2" aka "V2" supersedes "cyclone_hk" as V2 includes all the plains from the original cyclone_hk.

V2 has been compiled from several dozen public wordlists / leaks such as hashkiller (jan 2020), hashes.org, crackstation, facebook names, weakpass, etc, and now includes over 2.5GB of plains from Hashmob.

V2 has been compiled, cleaned, sorted by probability and deduped. This method of wordlist generation is more efficient when cracking compared to running large, multi-gigabyte wordlists that are sorted alphabetically, especially when cracking slow algos or using large rulesets.

Please test V2 with your hash list + rules and report your findings.

Enjoy.
