Today I'm posting a custom wordlist I've created for our hashkiller members. 
This wordlist has been developed from multiple public wordlists such as hashkiller (jan 2020), hashes.org (2012-2020), crackstation, weakpass, etc.

What's unique about this wordlist is it has been cleaned, sorted by probability and deduped, so it's more efficient compared to large, multi gigabyte wordlists that are sorted alphabetically, especially when cracking slow algos or using large rulesets.

While there's no "best wordlist", this has proven to be a very effective wordlist against multiple databases I've tested it with.

Enjoy.
