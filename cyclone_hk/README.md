### Please use cyclone_hk_v2 instead as it supersedes cyclone_hk.

I've compiled a wordlist, cyclone_hk.txt, for our hashkiller members.

This wordlist has been compiled from several dozen public wordlists / leaks such as hashkiller (jan 2020), hashes.org, crackstation, weakpass, etc, and does not contain any private wordlists / leaks.

This wordlist has been compiled, cleaned, sorted by probability, deduped, and the top 250 million plaintext (257,823,993 lines, 2.6gb) saved to cyclone_hk.txt. This method of wordlist generation is more efficient when cracking compared to running large, multi-gigabyte wordlists that are sorted alphabetically, especially when cracking slow algos or using large rulesets.

While there's no "best wordlist", cyclone_hk.txt has proven to be an effective wordlist in my testing.

Feel free to test cyclone_hk.txt with your hash list + rules and report your findings.

Enjoy.

PS

I have not included a test set for cyclone_hk.txt like I did on Hashcat Rules Comparison due to cyclone_hk.txt wordlist contains about 98% of the stockx plaintext which gives it an unfair advantage.
